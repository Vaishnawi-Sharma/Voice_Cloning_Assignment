# Voice Cloning Project

This project demonstrates **Voice Cloning** – generating speech that mimics a target speaker’s voice using **TTS (Text-to-Speech) models**.

## Tutorial Followed
- [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iqvBEGS2So)  
- Used Google and AI assistance whenever I got stuck

## Audio Source:
The audio used in this project was sourced from LibriVox.org, and was used solely for experimentation and learning purposes.

## Steps Completed
- Data Generation & Preparation  
- Uploading Audio File  
- Audio File Cleanup & Transcribing  
- Chunking  
- Uploading to Hugging Face  
- Unsloth Dependency Installation  
- Training the CSM-1B Model  
- Data Preparation (Continuing; encountered errors)

## Challenges / Confusing Steps
1. Chunking  
2. Uploading to Hugging Face  
3. Dataset Prep Functions (due to torchcodec installation error)

## GPU / Resource Requirements
- **T4 GPU** used

## Notes
Due to limited time and encountering challenges in **Chunking, Uploading to Hugging Face, and some dataset preparation errors**, I was able to complete the project up to this point.  

Due to time constraints, fine-tuning could not be completed. With additional time, I would have continued steps to enhance the current model’s performance on the dataset.  

Despite these challenges, the current notebook demonstrates the workflow from data preparation to model training.
